# cluster_analysis
Application of k-means clustering to a synthetic dataset

### About the dataset
This Python script creates a pre-defined nunber of records that are intentionally clustered around three typical travel patterns: Morning Commute, Mid-day Errands, and Late Night Transit. This structure makes it ideal for practicing K-Means clustering, as the model is expected to naturally discover the three underlying groups.
